    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These planes intersect at a ray in 3D space that is represented as the line of intersection between the two planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Transforming the Planes to the Tangent Plane\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we transform the planes from the image space into the local coordinates of the 2D Gaussian primitive (the tangent plane). Using the transformation matrix $ M = (WH)^{-1} $, we apply the inverse transpose to the planes:\n",
    "\n",

    "h_v = (WH)^\\top h_y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ W $ is the camera transformation matrix and $ H $ is the transformation matrix from the tangent plane to the world coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Solving for the Intersection\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to solve for the intersection point $(u, v) $ of the ray with the transformed tangent plane. We do this by solving the following system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_u \\cdot (u, v, 1, 1)^\\top = 0 \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ h_i^u $ and $ h_i^v $ are the homogeneous parameters of the transformed planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Evaluating the Gaussian at the Intersection\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the coordinates $ (u, v) $, we can evaluate the 2D Gaussian function at the intersection point. The Gaussian function is typically of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G(u, v) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "This represents the Gaussian value at the point $ (u, v) $ on the tangent plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the values of $ u(x) $ and $ v(x) $ are found, we can compute the depth of the intersection point using the following equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = (x_z, y_z, z, z)^\\top = W P(u, v) = W H (u, v, 1, 1)^\\top\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, $ W $ is the camera projection matrix, and $ H $ is the transformation matrix from the tangent plane to world coordinates. The last component of the resulting vector $ x = (xz, yz, z, z)^\\top $ gives the depth $ z $ of the intersection point (the third element, need to make sure). "
